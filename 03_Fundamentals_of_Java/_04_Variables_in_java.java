        // ● To identify the storage location, each variable needs to have a special name.

        // ● A data type is assigned to a variable (we will learn about it after this topic).

        // supplying an equal sign and a value (initialization i.e. assigning an initial value, is
        // optional). However, a Java uninitialized local variable is never given a default
        // value by the compiler.
