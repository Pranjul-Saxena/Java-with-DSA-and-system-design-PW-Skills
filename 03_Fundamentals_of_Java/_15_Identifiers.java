        // An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers
        // must have different names.

        // In Java, there are a few points to remember while dealing with identifiers :
        // Rule 1 − All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), $ and _ and must be
        // unique.
        // Rule 2 − After the first character/letter, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
        // Rule 3 − A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
        // Rule 4 − The identifiers are case-sensitive.
        // Rule 5 – Whitespaces are not permitted.0
        
        // Examples of legal identifiers: rank, $name, _rate, __2_mark.
        // Examples of illegal identifiers: 102pqr, -name.

        // every variable name and or function or other which is use to identify data
    }
