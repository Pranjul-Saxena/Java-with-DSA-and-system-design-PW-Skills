        // 1. Syntax Error :- If we write wrong syntax.
        // 2. Logical Error :- Our logic is wrong in the code. 
        // 3. Runtime Error :- Some Error on the running time of the code. like 5 divided by 0 this code is right but java shows the error.. 


        // What is an Exception?
        // ● An unwanted/expected event that disturbs the normal flow of execution of a program is called "Exception handling".
        // ● The main objective of Exception handling is to handle the exception.
        // ● It is available for graceful termination of program.
