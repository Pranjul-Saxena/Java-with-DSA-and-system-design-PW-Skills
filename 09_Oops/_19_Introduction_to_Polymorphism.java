// What is polymorphism ?
// if one thing exists in more than one form then it is called polymorphism. 
// Polymorphism is a Greek word, where poly means many and morphism means structures or forms.

// 1. Static Polymorphism .
// 2. Dynamic Polymorphism . 



// How to achieve polymorphism:

// Polymorphism in Java can be achieved in two ways i.e., method overloading and method overriding.
// Polymorphism in Java is mainly divided into two types.

// 1. Static Polymorphism:
// If polymorphism exists at compilation time then it is called Static Polymorphism.
// Ex: Overloading.

// 2. Dynamic Polymorphism:
// If the polymorphism exists at runtime then that polymorphism is called Dynamic
// Polymorphism.
// Ex: Overriding
