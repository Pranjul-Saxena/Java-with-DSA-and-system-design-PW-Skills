# Operators in Java

Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators



# Incrementation and Decrementation

++ Increment
-- Decrement


# Conditional Operators

When a condition consists of multiple boolean expressions, they are used. Use
conditional operators to combine two expressions, such as when we wish to print
a number only if it is larger than 2 and less than 5, respectively.

We have 3 types of conditional operators -
● Logical-and Operator(&&)
● Logical-or Operator(||)
● Ternary operator(?:)



# Conditional Statements

Java follows suit by using conditional statements to manage the program's flow.
This is crucial because at some time, in order to advance with our code, we must
fulfil requirements. For example, the console's yes or no input will determine
whether the programme is to be continued or cancelled.

Java has the following conditional statements:
● If statement
● else statement
● If-else Ternary
● Nested if-else
● Switch statement





# Introduction to Iterative statements/Loops

In Java, we have 3 types of iterative statements -

1. The while loop
2. The for loop
3. The do-while loop




# Break Keyword

It is a special keyword used to terminate the execution of the nearest executing
loop. It can be used in cases where we want the immediate termination of a loop
based upon certain conditions.





# Continue Keyword

It is a special keyword used to skip to the next iteration of the loop. It can be used in
cases where we want the remaining block of code to get executed in the loop for
the specific iteration.





# Using labels with continue and break keywords

In this we label a specific loop, just like we name a variable, and then use the
continue or break statement to apply continue/break on that specific loop. 





# Scanner class and User input in Java

In java to take the inputs from the keyboard we use Scanner class.
Scanner class is present in java.util package.

To use this scanner class in our programs we need to import the Scanner class
as shown below

import java.util.Scanner
● To take integer input from the user we use nextInt().
● Similarly to take String input from the user we use next().
