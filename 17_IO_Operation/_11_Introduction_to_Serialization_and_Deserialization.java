        // Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes,
        // so that it can be stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved in a
        // database. This process is called serialization because it involves taking an
        // object and turning it into a series of bytes that can be "serialized" into a
        // file or other storage medium.

        // Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into an
        // object. In other words, it is the process of taking the bytes that were
        // produced during serialization and turning them back into an object.

        // Serialization and deserialization are important concepts in Java because they
        // allow you to store and retrieve objects in a persistent manner, meaning that
        // the data will be preserved even if the application is closed or the computer
        // is turned off.
